// ArticleRequest is the request payload for Article data model.
//
// NOTE: It's good practice to have well defined request and response payloads
// so you can manage the specific inputs and outputs for clients, and also gives
// you the opportunity to transform data on input or output, for example
// on request, we'd like to protect certain fields and on output perhaps
// we'd like to include a computed field based on other values that aren't
// in the data model. Also, check out this awesome blog post on struct composition:

type ArticleRequest struct {
	*Article

	User *UserPayload `json:"user,omitempty"`

	ProtectedID string `json:"id"` // override 'id' json to have more control
}

func (a *ArticleRequest) Bind(r *http.Request) error {
	// a.Article is nil if no Article fields are sent in the request. Return an
	// error to avoid a nil pointer dereference.
	if a.Article == nil {
		return errors.New("missing required Article fields.")
	}

	// a.User is nil if no Userpayload fields are sent in the request. In this app
	// this won't cause a panic, but checks in this Bind method may be required if
	// a.User or futher nested fields like a.User.Name are accessed elsewhere.

	// just a post-process after a decode..
